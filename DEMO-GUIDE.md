## Questions to Anticipate

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: This is a visual demo. Production would need real smart contracts, wallet integration, and backend infrastructure.

**Q: How does Hydra actually work?**
A: Hydra creates state channels (Hydra Heads) for off-chain transactions, then settles final state on L1. Perfect for recurring payments.

**Q: What about security?**
A: Privacy-first design. Only wallet address stored. All analytics client-side. Users can export or delete data anytime.

**Q: Can I use this today?**
A: This is a demo showcasing the vision. Real implementation would require Cardano wallet integration and smart contract deployment.
