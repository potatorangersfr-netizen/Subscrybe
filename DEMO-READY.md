## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS

### Problem Statement
"Traditional blockchain fees make micro-payments impossible. Paying $0.10 for an article costs $0.10 in fees - that's 100% overhead."

### Solution
"Hydra enables batching 100 payments with only 2 on-chain transactions. This reduces fees from 17 ADA to 0.34 ADA - a 98% reduction."

### Impact
"This unlocks entirely new business models: pay-per-article journalism, micro-subscriptions, and usage-based pricing become economically viable."

### Technical Innovation
"We're using Cardano's Layer 2 Hydra protocol for instant finality and dramatically lower fees, while maintaining the security of the main chain."

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If something breaks:
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Check backend logs: `getProcessOutput` for process 14
3. Check frontend logs: `getProcessOutput` for process 4
4. Restart servers if needed
5. Clear browser cache

### Common Issues:
- **Privacy page error**: Fixed! ✅
- **Hydra demo not running**: Make sure you're on /hydra
- **Subscriptions not loading**: Check backend is running
