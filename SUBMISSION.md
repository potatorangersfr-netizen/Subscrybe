## 🎯 Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency users manage an average of 8+ subscriptions across different platforms (DeFi protocols, DAOs, content creators, SaaS tools). Current challenges:

- **No Unified View**: Subscriptions scattered across wallets and platforms
- **Budget Chaos**: Hard to track total monthly spending
- **High Fees**: L1 transaction costs add up quickly
- **Privacy Concerns**: Centralized platforms track user behavior
- **Manual Management**: No automated payment tracking

1. **Unifies All Subscriptions** - Single dashboard for all crypto subscriptions
2. **Leverages Hydra** - 100x faster, 88% cheaper transactions via Layer 2
3. **Protects Privacy** - Client-side analytics, minimal data collection
4. **Automates Payments** - Smart contract-based recurring payments
5. **Empowers Users** - Full data export and account deletion
